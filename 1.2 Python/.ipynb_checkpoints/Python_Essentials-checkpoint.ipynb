    "A library is a bundle of code made to help you accomplish routine tasks more quickly. Seaborn, for example, allows you to create visualizations with as little as one line of code. Without such a library, you’d have to write a ton of code to take an object and render a chart. Python is a popular language for data analysis in part because it has extremely robust libraries for data manipulation, visualization, machine learning, and a host of other applications."
